# 🧩 Project Overview

This project is a simple command-line calculator developed using Python. The main purpose of the project is to understand the basics of programming and learn how software is developed using professional tools such as Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub. The calculator can perform four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes a menu-driven system to make the program easy to use.

This project was created as part of an academic assignment focused on programming fundamentals and version control skills. Through this project, I learned how to structure a small program, maintain a clean codebase, commit changes properly, and upload the project to GitHub.

## 🛠 Development Process

The development of the calculator project was completed in the following steps:

### 1️⃣ Planning
- Identified required operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exit.
- Decided that the program should run continuously in a loop to allow multiple calculations.

### 2️⃣ Writing the Code
- Functions were created for each mathematical operation to keep the program modular and readable.
- A menu-based system was added so users could choose the type of calculation.
- Error handling was implemented to prevent division-by-zero errors.

### 3️⃣ Testing
- The program was tested using positive numbers, negative numbers, and decimal values.
- Additional testing was done for invalid input handling.

### 4️⃣ Using Git and GitHub
- The project folder was initialized as a Git repository.
- Multiple commits were made with meaningful commit messages.
- The final project was pushed to a GitHub repository.

 5️⃣ Documentation
- A README file was created with instructions and screenshots.
- Markdown-based documentation was added inside the docs/ folder.

Future Improvements

Possible enhancements for future versions of the calculator include:

- ✔ Adding a graphical interface using Tkinter.
- ✔ Including advanced operations such as exponent, square root, and percentage.
- ✔ Implementing a history feature to save past calculations.
- ✔ Adding unit testing to improve code reliability.
- ✔ Improving error handling using exception handling (try/except).
